# CodeBreaker
Here's a little logic game I wrote based on a board game MasterMind/CodeBreaker for my own satisfaction. The main idea behind that was to
have some small project on which I could learn how to do tests in C++ using Google Test technology.  
The game is well-described and it's a console game. My main project (with tests) is developed for Linux but if you want to checkout the game itself I also provide .exe file for a windows users.  
  
For Linux (makefile):
- make compile - compile the files  
- make play - play the game  
- make tests - do the tests  
  
For Windows:
- download the .exe from https://github.com/LucasJezap/CodeBreaker-google-test-training/blob/master/CodeBreaker.exe
